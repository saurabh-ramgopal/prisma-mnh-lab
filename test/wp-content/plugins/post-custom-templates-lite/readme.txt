**How Post Custom Templates works - The workflow**

It is pretty easy to create a beautiful custom responsive template for your single posts. It is all done in the plugin interface with zero coding requirement. And it works on any theme.

The short version is: 

* Create a new custom single post template using our Template Builder
* Change your theme's template

Bellow we go in a little more details…


**Create Custom Single Post Templates** 

If you want to create a beautiful custom template for your single posts this is the perfect tool for that. No need to deal with code, files, developers any more.

It is all done in a nice and easy template builder. Here is how it works:

* Create the layout via the Grid Manager interface. All layouts are responsive by default.
* Insert post attributes/items in the layout- title, meta, media, description, comments, next/previous navigation, social icons, related posts, author info, facebook comments, breadcrumbs, ads, sidebars, etc.
* Re-arrange the post attributes if you need to – drag & drop.
* You can change the default settings for some of the post items if you'd like.
* Hit Save

Create as many templates as you like. Edit the templates and the template's settings any time.

**Change your theme’s template**

It takes one click to change the theme’s template with the one you just created. You can change your mind any time and change it with another template. Again, there is no need to deal with code or files.


**Post attributes / items that you can insert in your templates**

Here are what items you can insert in your templates:

* Post Title
* Post Media
* Meta Items
* Post Description / Post editor content
* Breadcrumbs
* Post Social Icons
* Post Prev/Next Nav
* Related Posts
* WordPress Comments
* Facebook Comments
* Post Author Info
* Divider
* Ads Shortcode
* Sidebars

Once any item is inserted you can drag & drop it to another column if you want to change it's place.


**Meta items - drag & drop rearrangement**

Post meta items – categories, tags, author, date, comments, post visits can be re-arranged. And whatever is that you do not want to see can be disabled. All drag & drop.


**Featured Images**

In the template options you can set the media cropping width and height so your images fit your template better. You can also do this for the related posts images.


**Social like and share buttons**

Increase traffic! Enable Social like and share options. You can choose from variety of like and share buttons or put your custom once. 


**Facebook comments**

Increase traffic! Enable Facebook Comments in your Posts. Set up is easy and takes no time. 


**Related Posts**

Display related posts under each post so you can increase traffic to other posts too. Select Related post criteria: by Category or by Tag. 


**Translation/Localization**

This plugin comes Localization/Internationalization ready. It is following WordPress I18n standards.
